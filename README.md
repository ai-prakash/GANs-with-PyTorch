Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) - PyTorch Implementation 🚀
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate realistic images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) and learns to generate fake images that resemble real ones.
